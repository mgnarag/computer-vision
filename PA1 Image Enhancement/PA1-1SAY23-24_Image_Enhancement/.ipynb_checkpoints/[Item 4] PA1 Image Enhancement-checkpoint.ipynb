    "# Programming Assignment 1 - OpenCV Exercises Image Enhancement\n",
    "\n",
    "by Mark Jeremy G. Narag\n",
    "\n",
    "This Programming Assignment has seven (7) parts which tackles 7 different tasks. This is PART 4.\n",

    "\n",
    "All codes were executed using Jupyter Notebook in Macbook Air M1 MacOS Ventura 13.4.1\n",
    "\n",
    "## PART 4: Write code that continuously reads frames from your webcam, turns the result to grayscale, and performs Canny edge detection on the image. Display all three stages of processing as three different images in one window.\n",
    "(Hint: create another image of the same height but three times the width as the video frame. Copy the images into this by creating three new image headers that point to the beginning of and to one-third and two-thirds of the way into the image data.)"
